# CICS Asynchronous API Redbooks Examples

This repository holds example applications and code related to the IBM
Redbooks publication [_IBM CICS Asynchronous API: Concurrent
Processing Made Simple_][book]. For more detail see the readme for the
particular example.

## Examples

### [Web banking](web-banking/)
Have a parent program coordinate the fetching of the account holder's
name, along with their current and other accounts. If time allows,
fetch a loan rate specific for that customer. Use the CICS
asynchronous API to perform these activities concurrently.
